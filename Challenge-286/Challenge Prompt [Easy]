CHALLENGE PROMPT
Description:
Nearly everyone is familiar with the factorial operator in math. 5! yields 120 because factorial means 
"multiply successive terms where each are one less than the previous":
5! -> 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 -> 120
Simple enough.
Now let's reverse it. Could you write a function that tells us that "120" is "5!"?
120 -> 120/2 -> 60/3 -> 20/4 -> 5/5 -> 1 => 5!

Challenge Input:
3628800
479001600
6
18

Challenge Output:
3628800 = 10!
479001600 = 12!
6 = 3!
18  NONE
