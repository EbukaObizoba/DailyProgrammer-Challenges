Description:
We are going to create a mini game. I'm going post updates with ideas, if you guys have them.
The goal of the game is to escape a maze and not get eaten by the trolls.

Phases of the Game:
Phase 1 - Create your character and make it moveable. You can use this amazing maze (see what I did there?) 
or create one yourself. If you are going to use ASCII for the game, I suggest you use <>v^ for your character since 
direction becomes importend.
Place the character in a random spot and navigate it to the exit. X marks the exit.
Phase 2 - We have a more powerfull character now. He can push blocks that are in front of him. He can only push blocks 
into an empty space, not into another block.
Phase 3 - Let's add some trolls. Place trolls at random spots and let them navigate to you character. You can avoid the 
trolls by pushing blocks. The trolls should move a block when you move a block, so it is turnbased.
Phase 4 - Generate your own maze.
